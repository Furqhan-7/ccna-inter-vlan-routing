# Inter-VLAN Routing in Cisco Packet Tracer  

## Project Overview  
A simple CCNA project using **1 router, 2 switches, and 4 PCs** to configure Inter-VLAN Routing.  

## Devices Used  
- 1 Router  
- 2 Switches  
- 4 PCs  

## Steps  
1. Create VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 on switches.  
2. Assign PCs to the correct VLANs.  
3. Configure trunk links between switches and router.  
4. Configure sub-interfaces on the router with IP addresses.  
5. Set IP addresses and default gateways on PCs.  
6. Test connectivity with ping.  

## Result  
- PCs in different VLANs can communicate with each other.
